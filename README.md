# wikitable-web-scraper

Simple tkinter-based GUI to get wikitables given a URL and save as CSV.

Version notes

V.0.1 - Gets first wikitable in a given page and no others. Currently able to display with pandastable, however, the feature is incomplete. I intend to add editing functionality to the table
